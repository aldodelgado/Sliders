Sliders v0.01
=============

Croogo plugin to manage sliders and their slides, uses various slider libraries.

Libraries included so far:
- OneByOne (jQuery)
- bxSlider (jQuery)

Note: I've only just started working on this ... it needs a lot more work.  
Happy for people to get involved, give me their thoughts on it.
